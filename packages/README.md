# The Strapi monorepo

Juggling a multimodule project over multiple repos is pretty difficult for contributing.

Strapi follows a monorepo approach, all officially maintained modules are in the same repository-- this one.

Pros:
- Single lint, build, test and release process.
- Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
- Single place to report issues and track milestones.
- Easier to setup a development environment.

Cons:
- Codebase looks more intimidating.
- Repo is bigger in size.
