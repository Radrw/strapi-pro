# Contribute to the project

Strapi is an open-source project administered by [the Strapi team](http://strapi.io).

We welcome and encourage everyone who want to help us on Strapi.

Before contributing, ensure that your effort is aligned with the project's roadmap by talking to the maintainers, especially if you are going to spend a lot of time on it. Feel free to [join us on Slack](http://slack.strapi.io) if you are interested in helping us or [drop us an email](mailto:hi@strapi.io) if you are interested in working with us.

### Open Development & Community Driven
Strapi is open-source under the [MIT license](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/LICENSE.md). All the work done is available on GitHub.
The core team and the contributors send pull requests which go through the same validation process.

Every user can send a feature request using the [issues](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues) on GitHub.


### Repository Organization
We made the choice to use a monorepo design such as [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages), [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages) or [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages) do. It allows the community to easily maintain the whole ecosystem up-to-date and consistent.

The Babel team wrotes an excellent short post about [the pros and cons of the monorepo design](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md).

We will do our best to keep the master branch clean as possible, with tests passing all the times. However, it can happen that the master branch moves faster than the release cycle. To ensure to use the latest stable version, please refers to the [release on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strapi).

If you send a pull request, please do it again the `master` branch. We are developing upcoming versions separately to ensure non-breaking changes from master to the latest stable major version.


### Setup Development Environment
To facilitate the contribution, we drastically reduce the amount of commands necessary to install the entire development environment. First of all, you need to check if you're using the recommended versions of Node.js (v8) and npm (v5).

**Then, please follow the instructions below:**

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone it to your computer `git clone git@github.com:strapi/strapi.git`.
3. Run `npm run setup` at the root of the directory.

> Note: If the installation failed, please remove the global packages related to Strapi. The command `npm ls strapi` will help you to find where your packages are installed globally.

The development environment has been installed. Now, you have to create a development project to live-test your updates.

1. Go to a folder on your computer `cd /path/to/my/folder`.
2. Create a new project `strapi new myDevelopmentProject --dev`.
3. Start your app with `strapi start`.

Awesome! You are now able to make bug fixes or enhancements in the framework layer of Strapi. **To make updates in the administration panel, you need to go a little bit further.**

4. Open a new tab or new terminal window.
5. Go to the `/admin` folder of your currently running app.
6. Run `npm start` and go to the following url [http://localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin)

### Plugin Development Setup

To create a new plugin, you'll have to run the following commands

1. In your project folder `cd myDevelopmentProject && strapi generate:plugin my-plugin`.
2. Make sure that the `strapi-helper-plugin` is linked to your plugin
  - In the folder where strapi is cloned `cd pathToStrapiRepo/strapi/packages/strapi-helper-plugin && npm link`.
  - In your project folder `cd pathToMyProject/myDevelopmentProject/plugins/my-plugin && npm link strapi-helper-plugin`.
3. Start the server in the admin folder `cd pathToMyProject/myDevelopmentProject/admin && npm start` and go to the following url [http://localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin).

## Reporting an issue

Before reporting an issue you need to make sure:
- You are experiencing a concrete technical issue with Strapi (ideas and feature proposals should happen [on Slack](http://slack.strapi.io)).
- You are not asking a question about how to use Strapi or about whether or not Strapi has a certain feature. For general help using Strapi, please refer to [the official Strapi documentation](http://strapi.io). For additional help, ask a question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/strapi).
- You have already searched for related [issues](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues), and found none open (if you found a related _closed_ issue, please link to it in your post).
- Your issue title is concise, on-topic and polite.
- You can provide steps to reproduce this issue that others can follow.
- You have tried all the following (if relevant) and your issue remains:
  - Make sure you have the right application started.
  - Make sure you've killed the Strapi server with CTRL+C and started it again.
  - Make sure you closed any open browser tabs pointed at `localhost` before starting Strapi.
  - Make sure you do not have any other Strapi applications running in other terminal windows.
  - Make sure the application you are using to reproduce the issue has a clean `node_modules` directory, meaning:
    * no dependencies are linked (e.g. you haven't run `npm link`)
    * that you haven't made any inline changes to files in the `node_modules` folder
    * that you don't have any weird global dependency loops. The easiest way to double-check any of the above, if you aren't sure, is to run: `$ rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`.
